# LaserTripwire
2nd Grade Science Project 

**Problem:**
I want to create a laser tripwire that sets off an alarm when the beam is broken

**Laser Tripwire Materials**
Hardware: 
Raspberry Pi Pico W (microcontroller) - Power, Ground, Input, Output
Breadboard - Connect circuit prototypes without solder
Photoresistor - Light Dependent Resistor
Passive Buzzer - Proivedes Alarm/Sound    
S8050 Transistor - Amplifier for buzzer
Resistors - Control electricity by limiting the current
Wires - Connect everything in the circuit
Battery -  Provide power
USB-C cable - Connect battery to Raspberry Pi Pico W for power
Laser or light -  Provides the tripwire
Straw - Block unwanted light from photoresistor 
Play-Doh - Support and aim the laser

**Software:**
Thonny -  Program for writing Python (MicroPython) code

**Shoot a laser at a photoresistor**
Measure the light
When the light is broken set off a buzzer
Use a Microcontroller to manage the photoresistor and buzzer
Use Python (MicroPython) to program the microcontroller
Use a breadboard to connect the components 
Use a battery to power the microcontroller
